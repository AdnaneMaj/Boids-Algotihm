# Boids Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Boids Algorithm, a behavioral model for simulating the flocking and herding behavior of birds, fish, or other entities. The Boids Algorithm was developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986.

Boids simulates the flocking behavior by applying three simple rules to each boid (bird-like object) in the simulation:
1. **Separation**: Boids avoid crowding by maintaining a certain distance from each other.
2. **Alignment**: Boids steer towards the average heading of their neighbors.
3. **Cohesion**: Boids steer towards the average position of their neighbors.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
